# findJudge

NAME: Michelle Quach

DATE OF COMPLETION: November 6, 2020 

PURPOSE OF LAB: Understanding how graphs work.  

METHOD USED: We know that the judge is trusted by everyone but themself(N-1) so we have to find the integer that is found N-1 times in the graph. If the person is trusted, we increment the count since the people trust the judge. If the person trusts someone else, we decrement the count since the judge does not trust anyone. Once this is completed with all of the people in the town. We check to see which person had a count that is N-1. This person will be the judge.
